# GUI-based-image-compression-Using-python


In this task we have actualized the JPEG Image standard utilizing Median Cut Algorithm Using Python 3.6.We have done both the encoding and deciphering of grayscale pictures in JPEG. 

In this task we have additionally Make GUI for the Selection of the picture And Save the Image. Median cut is a calculation to kind of a discretionary number of measurements into arrangement of sets by recursively cutting each arrangement of information at the median point along the longest measurement. 

Median cut is regularly utilized for shading quantization. For instance, to diminish a 64k-shading picture to 256 hues, median cut is utilized to discover 256 hues that coordinate the first information well.
